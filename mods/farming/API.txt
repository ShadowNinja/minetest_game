Farming API
===========

The farming API allows you to easily register plants and hoes.

  * `farming.register\_hoe(name, hoe definition)` Register a new hoe, see
	[Hoe definition](#hoe-definition).
  * `farming.register\_plant(name, Plant definition)`: Register a new
	growing plant, see [Plant definition](#plant-definition).

Hoe Definition
---------------
```Lua
{
	description = "",	-- Description for tooltip
	inventory_image = "unknown_item.png",	-- Image to be used as wield and inventory images
	max_uses = 30,	-- Uses until destroyed
	material = "",	-- Material for recipes
	recipe = {	-- Craft recipe, if material isn't used
		{"air", "air", "air"},
		{"", "group:stick"},
		{"", "group:stick"},
	}
}
```

Plant definition
-----------------
```Lua
{
	description = "",	-- Description of seed item
	inventory_image = "unknown_item.png",	-- Image to be used as seed's wield and inventory images
	steps = 8,	-- How many steps the plant has to grow, until it can be harvested
	^ Always provide a plant texture for each step, format: modname_plantname_i.png (i = stepnumber)
	minlight = 13, -- Minimum light to grow
	maxlight = default.LIGHT_MAX -- Maximum light to grow
}
```
